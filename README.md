# Molecular-Geometry
emulates the 3D structure of various molecules in Processing

controls:
z,x,c  to choose which axis to rotate around, then mousewheel  to rotate 
d  then mousehwheel to choose nucleus-electron distance
a to toggle displaying angles
b to toggle displaying unbonded pairs
press   'n'  then   '0-7' to choose number of bonds and then  '1-7' to choose number of electron domains to create new atom. 
ex.  'n  3  5'  creates a trigonal planar molecular geometry and a trigonal bipyramidal electronic geometry.
'r'  resets rotation
